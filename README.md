Our project is to develop an Android application, which develop social network among its users based on the users real life social activity, such as meetings, voice calls, and text messages.

The instruction for our application is as following:

    Click “Start”, then enter the user name and password to login.
    Click “Social Stars” to see the friend list of your best friends and popular stars in the network.
    Bump your phone with your friend, if “match” shows on the title, then click “Connect” to confirm the meeting. Click “Disconnect” to end the meeting manually, or the meeting will end when you and your friends are over 50 meters apart automatically.
